    text: `In 1996, a devastating flood hit the Czech town of Třeboň. When water levels rose, an elderly man was trapped in his small house. He assumed no one would come for him, until he saw a swan floating outside his window, tapping its beak on the glass. Curious, he followed the bird as it swam to higher ground, where rescuers were searching. The man was saved. For years after, he left bread for the swans every morning, calling them his “guides through the water.”`,

    text: `In Japan’s 2011 earthquake and tsunami, a dog named Ban was found drifting on the roof of a destroyed house three kilometers out at sea. When rescuers finally pulled her onto a boat, she was weak but wagging her tail. The story spread across the country, and after days in a shelter she was joyfully reunited with her owner, who had been searching desperately. Ban became a symbol of resilience — the little dog who refused to give up, even when stranded in the ocean.`,

    text: `In New Zealand in 2014, a pod of dolphins surprised a group of swimmers by circling tightly around them. The swimmers were confused at first, until they noticed a great white shark lurking nearby. For more than forty minutes, the dolphins kept a protective ring until the shark drifted away. Marine biologists later confirmed this wasn’t the first time dolphins had shielded humans from danger, adding another chapter to the long history of dolphins acting as guardians of the sea.`,

    text: `In Alaska in 1925, the town of Nome was struck by a deadly diphtheria outbreak. Medicine was hundreds of miles away, and blizzards blocked the trains. Mushers set out with sled dogs to relay the serum across the wilderness. The final leg was led by a husky named Balto, who guided his team through the stormy night. Exhausted but unwavering, they arrived with the life-saving medicine. Balto became a national hero, and a statue of him still stands in New York’s Central Park, honoring all the sled dogs who braved the journey.`,

    text: `In 2018, in India, a boy fell into a deep borewell and was trapped for hours. While rescue teams worked, a stray cow stood near the opening the entire time, refusing to leave. Villagers said it mooed whenever the boy called out, almost as if answering him. When the boy was finally pulled to safety, the cow licked his face before walking away. The family later said they believed the animal had stayed to comfort their son in the dark.`,

    text: `In 2019, in Poland, firefighters responded to reports of a child missing in the woods. When they finally located him hours later, he was asleep under a tree — curled up against his family’s dog. The dog had stayed by his side all night in the cold, keeping him warm. Rescuers said the boy likely would not have survived the freezing temperatures alone. The photo of the child clinging to his dog after being found spread worldwide as a reminder of loyalty and love.`,

    text: `In 1972, Uruguayan Flight 571 crashed high in the Andes. At first, survivors believed rescue would come within hours. Instead, days passed, food ran out, and avalanches buried their camp. In the frozen fuselage, they faced the unthinkable: to stay alive, they ate the flesh of the dead. Weeks later, two men—Parrado and Canessa—set out across mountains no one thought passable. Ten days later, half-dead, they found help. Sixteen people walked out of the Andes alive, a story of survival that shocked the world.`,

    text: `In 2003, thieves pulled off the Antwerp Diamond Heist, one of the largest in history. They bypassed heat sensors with hairspray, jammed locks with aluminum, and tunneled into a vault thought impenetrable. Over $100 million in gems and cash vanished overnight. Police were stunned—until one thief dumped a bag of trash in the wrong woods. Inside was a sandwich with his DNA. The crew was caught, but most of the diamonds were never recovered. To this day, they’re still missing.`,

    text: `In 1925, explorer Percy Fawcett vanished in the Amazon. He had gone in search of a mythical city he called “Z,” taking only two companions. Before leaving, he wrote: “If we disappear, do not look for us.” They vanished without a trace. For decades, rumors swirled—killed by tribes, swallowed by the jungle, or perhaps finding something they wished to keep hidden. No body, no journal, no proof has ever surfaced. Fawcett’s fate remains one of exploration’s enduring mysteries.`,

    text: `In 1937, the lighthouse keepers of Scotland’s Flannan Isles disappeared. A relief crew arrived to find the tower’s door unlocked, a meal half-eaten, and chairs overturned. The logbook ended mid-sentence. No bodies were ever found. The official report claimed a storm swept them to sea, but locals whispered of darker things: fights, madness, or even something supernatural. The mystery of the missing keepers has never been solved, leaving the lighthouse forever haunted by absence.`,

    text: `In 1932, Australian farmers begged for help: emus—giant flightless birds—were ravaging crops. The government sent soldiers with machine guns. What followed became known as the Great Emu War. The birds scattered before firing lines, outran trucks, and absorbed bullets with little effect. Thousands of rounds were fired, but the emus simply kept coming. Eventually, the military admitted defeat and withdrew. The birds had won. It remains one of history’s strangest “wars,” a reminder that sometimes nature cannot be outgunned.`,

    text: `In 1872, the merchant ship Mary Celeste was found drifting in the Atlantic. Sails full, cargo intact, no sign of struggle—yet the crew was gone. The captain’s log ended abruptly. Food was still on the table, water barrels full, and valuables untouched. The lifeboat was missing, but the sea was calm. No one ever saw the crew again. Theories range from mutiny to seaquakes to piracy, but none fit the evidence. The Mary Celeste remains the ocean’s most famous ghost ship.`,

    text: `In 1919, a storage tank in Boston’s North End burst, sending a wave of sticky molasses rushing through the streets. The wave was 25 feet high, moving at 35 miles per hour. Buildings crumpled, horses drowned, and 21 people were killed. Witnesses said the air smelled sweet for weeks, but the cleanup took years. Locals called it the “Great Molasses Flood,” and even a century later, some swear the pavement still turns tacky on hot summer days.`,

    text: `In 1845, Sir John Franklin led two ships—the Erebus and the Terror—into the Arctic, searching for the Northwest Passage. They never returned. Years later, searchers found the ships trapped in ice, abandoned with supplies still aboard. Skeletons showed signs of starvation, hypothermia, even cannibalism. Inuit stories spoke of desperate men wandering the ice. For 150 years the ships’ fate was unknown, until modern sonar finally located their wrecks on the seafloor. But Franklin’s body was never found.`,

    text: `In 1908, a massive explosion flattened 800 square miles of forest near Tunguska, Siberia. Witnesses described a fireball streaking across the sky before a thunderous shockwave knocked people off their feet. Trees for miles were scorched, all pointing outward from a single blast. Yet no crater was found. Scientists believe it was a meteor that exploded midair, releasing as much energy as 1,000 atomic bombs. No fragments were ever recovered, leaving mystery at the heart of the blast.`,

    text: `In 1950, a passenger plane bound for Miami vanished from radar. Moments earlier, the pilot had radioed: “We’re entering a storm… everything is strange here.” The plane, its 32 passengers, and crew were never found. No wreckage, no oil slick, no bodies. The disappearance became one of the cases fueling the legend of the Bermuda Triangle. Though skeptics blame weather or navigation errors, the fact remains: an entire aircraft simply disappeared into thin air.`,

    text: `In 1976, a group of armed men stormed a bank in Nice, France. But instead of grabbing quick cash, they spent two days underground, drilling into safety deposit boxes. Their leader, calling himself “The Artist,” left a note scrawled on the vault wall: “Without weapons, without violence, without hate.” They escaped with tens of millions in gold, jewelry, and cash. Police eventually caught some of the crew, but the mastermind vanished with most of the fortune.`,

    text: `In 1911, the Mona Lisa was stolen from the Louvre. For two years, no one knew where it had gone. Rumors swirled: foreign spies, master thieves, even Picasso was questioned. In the end, it was a museum handyman named Vincenzo Peruggia, who believed the painting belonged in Italy. He simply hid in a closet overnight, walked out with it under his coat, and kept it in his apartment. The theft turned the Mona Lisa into the world’s most famous painting.`,

    text: `In 1902, workers digging a railway tunnel in Antikythera, Greece, pulled up a barnacled bronze lump from a shipwreck. Decades later, scientists discovered gears hidden inside — an ancient Greek machine that could predict eclipses and planetary positions. Built over 2,000 years ago, the “Antikythera Mechanism” was so advanced it shocked historians. Often called the world’s first computer, it proved that ancient technology was far beyond what anyone had imagined.`,
