    text: `In 2012, in Bangladesh, a group of schoolchildren were playing near a riverbank when a stray dog began barking wildly. Moments later, the children realized a cobra had slithered close to them in the grass. The dog leapt forward, barking and snapping until the snake retreated back into the reeds. The children were unharmed, and villagers later said the stray had followed them for days afterward, almost like a guardian. It became known as the “school dog,” and locals fed it daily as thanks for saving their children.`,

    text: `In 1996, a devastating flood hit the Czech town of Třeboň. When water levels rose, an elderly man was trapped in his small house. He assumed no one would come for him, until he saw a swan floating outside his window, tapping its beak on the glass. Curious, he followed the bird as it swam to higher ground, where rescuers were searching. The man was saved. For years after, he left bread for the swans every morning, calling them his “guides through the water.”`,

    text: `In Japan’s 2011 earthquake and tsunami, a dog named Ban was found drifting on the roof of a destroyed house three kilometers out at sea. When rescuers finally pulled her onto a boat, she was weak but wagging her tail. The story spread across the country, and after days in a shelter she was joyfully reunited with her owner, who had been searching desperately. Ban became a symbol of resilience — the little dog who refused to give up, even when stranded in the ocean.`,

    text: `In Italy during World War II, an American soldier adopted a small brown mutt who had wandered onto their base. The dog, named Smoky, turned out to be more than just a mascot. She learned to run telephone wires through narrow pipes, a task too dangerous for soldiers under fire. Thanks to her, communication lines were restored quickly, saving lives. After the war, Smoky traveled the world, performing tricks to raise money for veterans, and became known as the first true therapy dog.`,

    text: `In New Zealand in 2014, a pod of dolphins surprised a group of swimmers by circling tightly around them. The swimmers were confused at first, until they noticed a great white shark lurking nearby. For more than forty minutes, the dolphins kept a protective ring until the shark drifted away. Marine biologists later confirmed this wasn’t the first time dolphins had shielded humans from danger, adding another chapter to the long history of dolphins acting as guardians of the sea.`,

    text: `In 1945, in a small French village, an oak tree was struck by lightning. Locals assumed it was dead, but instead of cutting it down, they decorated its trunk with lanterns every Christmas. Strangely, the following spring, fresh leaves sprouted. The oak survived, becoming a symbol of endurance for the town. Generations later, it still stands, its bark blackened from the strike, but its canopy alive and green. Villagers tell their children it is the tree that refused to die.`,

    text: `In Alaska in 1925, the town of Nome was struck by a deadly diphtheria outbreak. Medicine was hundreds of miles away, and blizzards blocked the trains. Mushers set out with sled dogs to relay the serum across the wilderness. The final leg was led by a husky named Balto, who guided his team through the stormy night. Exhausted but unwavering, they arrived with the life-saving medicine. Balto became a national hero, and a statue of him still stands in New York’s Central Park, honoring all the sled dogs who braved the journey.`,

    text: `In 2018, in India, a boy fell into a deep borewell and was trapped for hours. While rescue teams worked, a stray cow stood near the opening the entire time, refusing to leave. Villagers said it mooed whenever the boy called out, almost as if answering him. When the boy was finally pulled to safety, the cow licked his face before walking away. The family later said they believed the animal had stayed to comfort their son in the dark.`,

    text: `In the 1970s, in the Pacific Ocean, a sailor fell overboard at night during a storm. Just as he thought he’d be lost, a group of pilot whales appeared, nudging him toward the surface and keeping him afloat until his ship’s crew spotted the disturbance and pulled him back. The sailor later said he owed his life to “angels of the sea” — giant, gentle creatures that seemed to know he needed help.`,

    text: `In 2019, in Poland, firefighters responded to reports of a child missing in the woods. When they finally located him hours later, he was asleep under a tree — curled up against his family’s dog. The dog had stayed by his side all night in the cold, keeping him warm. Rescuers said the boy likely would not have survived the freezing temperatures alone. The photo of the child clinging to his dog after being found spread worldwide as a reminder of loyalty and love.`,
